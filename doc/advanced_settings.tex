\section{Notes}

\subsection{Choice Exponent}
Let $n$ be the number of interview slots.  Let $f_s$ be the ranked preference of faculty member F for a match with student S.  Let $s_f$ be the ranked preference of a student S for a match with faculty member F.  If F is S's first choice and S is F's first choice, then:
\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned}
		f_s = 1 \\
		s_f = 1
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Likewise, If F is S's second choice and S is F's third choice, then:
\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned}
		f_s = 3 \\
		s_f = 2
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Let $\alpha$ be a free parameter such that:
\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned}
		0 \le \alpha \le 1 \\
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Note that $(\alpha * 100)$ is the \texttt{Faculty Advantage Factor}

Let the $c$ be the \texttt{Choice Exponent}.  MatchMakr calculates the value, $v$, of a match using the following formula:
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:value}
	\begin{aligned}
		v = \left( (\alpha * (n - f_s + 1))^c + ((1-\alpha) * (n - s_f + 1))^c  \right) * 100\\
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

For:
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:n}
	\begin{aligned}
		n \ge f_s \forall f, s \\
		n \ge s_f \forall s, f		
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Note that the factor of 100 in Equation \ref{eq:value} helps MatchMakr perform optimization on integers.

Thus, we can see that $c$ is the an exponent. The first choice is assigned an exponentially higher value than the second choice.  $c$ controls the difference in value between the first choice and the second choice.

\subsection{Weights}

This section will discuss how to set the following weights:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \texttt{Recruiting Weight}
	\item \texttt{Track Weight}
	\item \texttt{Faculty Similarity Weight}
	\item \texttt{Lunch Penalty}
	\item \texttt{Empty Penalty}
\end{itemize}

Reasonable values for all these weights can be calculated using the same method.  Note that, if we don't wish to use any features controlled by these weights, we can just set the corresponding weights to 0.

To begin the process, let's look at Equation \ref{eq:value}.  To make our analysis easier, we will start by setting $\alpha = 1$.  This means that we will only consider faculty preferences.  The resulting equation is:

\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned}
		v = 100 (n - f_s + 1)^c  \\
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Suppose that, for our particular problem there are 9 interview slots ($n=9$).  Suppose that we also want there to be a large difference between the weight for the first preference and the weight of the second preference.  In this case, we can set $c=4$.  Plugging these values in, we see that
\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned}
		v = 100 (11 - f_s)^4  \\
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Recall that $f_s$ is the ranked preference of faculty member F for student S.  From Equation \ref{eq:n}, we see that $f_s$ can take on any value between 0 and $n$, where $n$ is the total number of interview slots.  We can plug in all values of $f_s$ and solve the equation.  Again, assuming that $n=9$, we get the following values:

\begin{table}[h!]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{| r | r|}
		\hline
		\textbf{Preference $f_s$} & \textbf{Value $v$} \\ \hline \hline
		
		1 & 656100 \\ 
		2 & 409600 \\ 
		3 & 240100 \\ 
		4 & 129600 \\ 
		5 & 62500 \\ 
		6 & 25600 \\ 
		7 & 8100 \\ 
		8 & 1600 \\ 
		9 & 100 \\ \hline
		
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{\label{tab:values} MatchMakr value for different preference numbers}
\end{table}

The default \texttt{Track Weight} is 30000.  In this example, we see that this weight is slightly more than giving a faculty member his/her $6^\text{th}$ choice, but not quite as high as giving a faculty member his/her $5^\text{th}$ choice.

Using this same method, we can choose weights based on how important we think factors are.  To start off, we suggest setting the weights like in this example (between the weights for the $5^\text{th}$ and $6^\text{th}$ choices), and then adjusting the weights, as necessary.

The only exception to this method is the \texttt{Empty Penalty} because it is unstable.  We recommend setting \texttt{Empty Penalty} to 0 and not attempting to tune it.
