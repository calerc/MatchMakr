\section{Purpose of MatchMakr}
MatchMakr is software that can be used to match interviewers with interviewees.  Originally, MatchMakr was designed to match prospective graduate students with faculty interviewers.  Because the words ``students'' and ``faculty'' are easier to differentiate than ``interviewer'' and ``interviewee,'' we will refer to interviewers as ``faculty'' or ``professors'' throughout this document, and we will refer to interviewees as ``students'' throughout this document.
