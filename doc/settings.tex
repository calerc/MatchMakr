		\tablinethree{Path}{Any valid file path}

		\tablinethree{Student Preferences}{Any valid \texttt{.csv} file name}
						{The name of the \texttt{.csv} file where the student preference data is
							stored.  By default, it is \texttt{student\_preferences.csv}.  This file should be found in the folder specified above in \texttt{Path}}

						{The name of the \texttt{.csv} file where the faculty preference data is
							stored.  By default, it is \texttt{faculty\_preferences.csv}.  This file should be found in the folder specified above in \texttt{Path}}
		\tablinethree{Student Availability}{Any valid \texttt{.csv} file name}
						{The name of the \texttt{.csv} file where the student availability data is
							stored.  By default, it is \texttt{student\_availability.csv}.  This file should be found in the folder specified above in \texttt{Path}.  If this file is not required, MatchMakr can be told not to look for it.  See Advanced Settings}

						{The name of the \texttt{.csv} file where the faculty availability data is
							stored.  By default, it is \texttt{faculty\_availability.csv}.  This file should be found in the folder specified above in \texttt{Path}.  If this file is not required, MatchMakr can be told not to look for it.  See Advanced Settings}	
		\tablinethree{Results Folder}{Any valid folder name}
						{The folder where the results will be output.  This is a subfolder of \texttt{Path} (specified above).}

		\tablinethree{Number of Interview}{0 - 99}
						{The number of interview slots that are available.}		
		\tablinethree{Minimum Number of Interviews}{0 - (Number of Interviews)}
						{The minimum number of interview slots that someone can be scheduled for.  If someone is available for fewer interview slots than \texttt{Minimum Number of Interviews}, then the person will be assigned the number of interviews that they are available for.}		
		\tablinethree{Maximum Number of Interviews}
						{\pbthreelarge{(Minimum Number of Interviews) \\- (Number of Interviews)}}
						{The maximum number of interview slots that someone can be scheduled for}	
		\tablinethree{Recommend Extra Matches}{0 - 99}
						{Number of extra matches to recommend.  This helps people find good matches that could not be scheduled and explore those matches outside of scheduled time.}	
		\tablinethree{Faculty Advantage Factor}{0 - 100}
						{A value of 50 weights student and faculty preferences equally.  A value of 100 causes MatchMakr to only consider faculty preferences and not consider student preferences.  A value of 0 causes MatchMakr to only consider student preferences and not consider faculty preferences. Changing this parameter can improve matches}
