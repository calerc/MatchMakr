\chapter{Collecting Data from Students and Faculty}

We will now discuss how to collect the input data for MatchMakr.

\section{Necessary Data}
The following table summarizes that data that we recommend collecting from students and faculty:

\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{| l | c | c | p{2in}| }
		\tabheader{Data:}{Students:}{Faculty:}{Notes:}
		\tabline{Last name}{Required}{Required}{}
		\tabline{First name}{Required}{Required}{}
		\tabline{\pb{List of preferred \\ faculty interviewers}}{Required}{Not Applicable}{MatchMakr can handle both ordered (ranked) and unordered (unranked) preferences, but we recommend using ordered preferences}
		\tabline{\pb{List of preferred \\ student interviewees}}{Not Applicable}{Required}{MatchMakr can handle both ordered (ranked) and unordered (unranked) preferences, but we recommend using ordered preferences}
		\tabline{\pb{Are you available \\ to interview?}}{Not Applicable}{Required}{Yes/No}
		\tabline{Are you recruiting?}{Not Applicable}{Recommended}{Yes/No/Maybe.  Faculty commonly don't know if they're recruiting until they hear about the status of their grants}
		\tabline{Track}{Recommended}{Recommended}{A ``track'' is just a common interest}
		\tabline{\pb{Are you willing to \\interview during lunch?}}{\notrecommended}{\notrecommended}{Only collect this data if there will be a large break during the interviews, and if interviews during that period are optional for the faculty}
	\end{tabular}
